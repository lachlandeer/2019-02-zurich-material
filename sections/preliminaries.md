# Preliminaries

## Introductions

* Instructors:
    * Uli
    * Julian
    * Lachlan (me)
* Organizers:
    * Lachlan
    * Eva
* Helpers:
    - Stephan Schmeing
- Learners:
    * You

## Learning Objectives


* **Goal:** gain familiarity with a 'reproducible' computational workflow
    * How?: *hands-on* workshop
    * Coverage:
        * the Unix Shell: text based instructions
        * Git: Version control
        * `R`

## Learning Objectives


*We don't expect you to have any computational experience before we start*

- By the end we want you to be able to:
    1. work with data in R (summary/group statistics, plotting) ...
    2. ... in a way that is reproducible by yourself and others
        - Version Controlled
        - Clear scripts and/or documentation
- Tip:
    - if lost, don't focus on the syntax, but on the way we think
        - you can google the syntax, hard to google how to think about a problem

## Learning Environment

* I like learning environments that are *relaxed*, but *focussed*
    * Communicate as peers, there's no hierachy in this room

* Feel free to:
    * Interupt and ask questions
    * Share relevant experiences
    * Let us know when something isn't working for you
    * Talk to us in breaks

* Why have we given you sticky notes?
    * Letting us know how you are progressing
    * Providing us with feedback

* There is a code of conduct [\alert{here}](http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/)
    * Summary: *Let's be nice to each other*

## Structure

* Day One:
    * Morning (now-ish): Unix Shell
    * Afternoon: Git
* Day Two:
    * Morning: `R` part 1
    * Afternoon: `R` part 2

* Session Times:
    * Morning: 09.30 - 12.30
    * Lunch: 12.30 - 14.00
    * Afternoon: 14.00 - 17.00

* There are coffee breaks... roughly half way through a session
* Join us for lunch
